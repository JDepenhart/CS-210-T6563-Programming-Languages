# CS-210-T6563-Programming-Languages
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was designed to read an input file for a grocery store which listed all items that were purchased during that day. Using information found in the file, the program can then display a list of the items with the number of times it appears on the list, allow the user to search for a particular item, or display a histogram based on the items found withing the file. 
What did you do particularly well?
I believe I handled the C++ side of the project particularly well. It felt like a culmination of multiple things I learned throughout the course. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe I could enhance my python code a bit more since I feel like it handled more input than necessary. If given more time, I would try to rework the input to only be found within the C++ code of the project. I would want to rework the Python code for exclusively reading and writing file data. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the python code to be the most challenging. Other than a few instances in this course, I have not used python in months, so trying to recall everything was a bit of a challenge. I manage to overcome this hurtle by scouring forums until I understood enough to code what I needed to. I did not find direct answers to anything, but I found enough to jog my memory of how things were done. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to use multiple languages in tandem with each other. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I wrote a lot of comments detailing exactly what my code did. I also made it a priority to ensure functions only did what was necessary. Doing this kept the code organized and allows me to easily find and edit what I want If I were to maintain or adapt it in the future.
